### Reinforcement learning framework developed from scratch in C++. Written by me (Muhamed Cicak) as part of my role for the finishing project for my university: creating a reinforcement learning agent to land an airplane in XPLANE12. 
### This code contains a lot of exercises done in the Barto Sutton book as this project was also a learning journey for me. 

### There is a separate repository called aiplane-xplane-sdk at https://github.com/Silidrone/aiplane-xplane-sdk, which was the part that my friends Gurur and Batuhan worked on, which deals with control of XPLANE12 and the communication with our RL agent. 

#### Note: For the taggame exercise, there is a separate repository which you need to run which is the taggame itself implemented in Java (base code - taken from my professor Dindar Oz from one of the courses I took - which I later modified to suit the socket communication and made some tweaks to the game): https://github.com/Silidrone/rl-taggame-java
